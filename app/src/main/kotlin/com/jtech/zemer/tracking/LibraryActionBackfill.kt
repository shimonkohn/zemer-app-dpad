/**
 * One-time upload of the currently-liked / currently-downloaded song snapshot as `action_backfill`
 * events (contract: handoff-docs/zemer-tracking-action-backfill-request.md — SETTLED, server-side
 * built). Mirrors [PlayHistoryBackfill] with the differences the contract settled:
 * - **Snapshot, not a log**: two snapshot queries over `song`, no id cursor or upper bound. Rows
 *   liked/downloaded after live action-tracking shipped are also live-tracked — a total, permanent
 *   overlap the server acknowledges and keeps segregated from live aggregates.
 * - **Resume by acked-line COUNT, not a row cursor**: the snapshot is recomputed on every attempt,
 *   and its timestamps are NOT stable — a device-zone change shifts every converted `t`, and
 *   `SyncUtils.likedSongs` rewrites every synced song's `likedDate` to sync time — so the server's
 *   (device, kind, id, t) dedup canNOT be relied on to absorb a full-snapshot replay. Persisting
 *   the count of acked lines and skipping that prefix on restart bounds a replay to the unacked
 *   tail (the row order is stable: favorites then downloads, both `ORDER BY id`; a library
 *   mutation between launches can misalign the prefix by at most a few rows, which dedup or the
 *   segregated table absorbs). The count also advances past a server-rejected batch — the
 *   never-retry policy below.
 * - **Own start delay** (after the play backfill's) to spread first-launch load — it does NOT
 *   guarantee ordering (the play drain is still running at 90 s for histories over ~1500 rows);
 *   [Tracker.uploadBackfill]'s single-in-flight discipline is what serializes the two on the wire.
 * - Downloads include machine-initiated ones (auto-download-on-like, self-repair) — the snapshot
 *   cannot reconstruct `fromUser`, which is why the server weights backfilled `download` as weak
 *   corroboration of `favorite`, never equal-weight.
